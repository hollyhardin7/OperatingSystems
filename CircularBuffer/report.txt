Project 2

I believe my Part 4 for Scenarios 1 and 2 are working correctly. They compiled
with no warnings or errors. There were no memory leaks. This project has
been difficult but has taught me a lot for what I have gotten done!

I used Matt's skeleton code for starting my code, circular_buffer.c
I referenced a piece of code from Joe Sventek.
I have helped Claire and I have worked in a group with Daniel and Derrick.

My code can be ran by executing "make" and:
1. Executing "./P4_Scenario1" for running the first scenario
2. Executing "./P4_Scenario2" for running the second scenario

I output information according to the grading criteria the best I could.
Output for scenario 1 can be found in the P4_Scenario1_output.txt file
and output for scenario 2 can be found in the P4_Scenario2_output.txt file
